   <p>
    First Edition is offered in three aluminum finishes (Oxide Gray, Travertine, and Heatshield), along with a lavish Veracity Titanium option. All switch plates are thick solid brass, with an electrodeposited matte silver chrome finish.
    <br><br>
    The aluminum housings are finished in plasma ceramic, an oxidation process that uses intense heat and pressure generated by a storm of rapid high-energy micro-arcs, which forms an advanced ceramic coating on the substrate. The result is a smooth matte finish of extraordinary durability and cosmetic uniformity, unlike anything we have offered before.
    <br><br>
    Travertine calls back to Ancient Rome and the Stoic philosopher namesake of the project. It is a warm gray that has a very fine stochastic micro-pattern of alternating light and dark areas resulting from the energy discharges. Although this pattern gives the appearance of a texture like natural stone, it is perfectly smooth to the touch. It comes paired with a black logo badge.

   <p>
    Through a single connection, make space for your preferred peripherals. The Plugable 7-in-1 USB-C Hub (USBC-7IN1E) lets you connect an extra 4K HDMI monitor, two USB devices like a mouse and keyboard, wired Gigabit Ethernet, SD or microSD cards, and 100W charging.
    <br><br>
    This compact and ruggedly constructed USB-C hub is engineered to fix the issues most commonly associated with USB hubs. With the latest, updated chipsets, you can expect a more reliable DisplayPort over USB-C signal, which means no more flickering screens. It also means intelligent power handling, which prevents overdrawing power. But most importantly, this hub supports consistency in port functionality so you can use all of the ports at the same time.

      What we need to do is always lean into the future; when the world changes around you and when it changes against you - what used to be a tail wind is now a head wind - you have to lean into that and figure out what to do because complaining isn't a strategy.
