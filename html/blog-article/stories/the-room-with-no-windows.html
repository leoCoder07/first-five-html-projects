      <p>
       Every night at exactly 10 p.m., Leo unlocked the side entrance of the unused office building and stepped into the room with no windows. The fluorescent lights flickered before settling into their usual harsh glow, washing the white walls in an artificial brightness that never changed. There was no clock on the wall, but Leo didn’t need one—his body had memorized the hours. He sat down in front of the security monitors, listening to the hum of electricity and the distant echo of footsteps from floors that were mostly empty.

       The job was meant to be temporary, something to help him get back on his feet. Months turned into years, and the room slowly became familiar, almost comforting in its predictability. During the long stretches of silence, Leo’s thoughts wandered to the life he rarely spoke about. He thought of friends he stopped replying to, phone calls he ignored because he didn’t know what to say, and plans he kept postponing until “someday.” The room had no windows, but his memories created openings where light used to be.

      <p>
       Some nights, Leo imagined what the room would feel like with a window—how the moonlight might soften the walls, how sunrise would mark the end of his shift. He realized he had been living like that room: closed off, functional, and untouched by change. It was easier to watch life through monitors than to step into it. Safety had slowly replaced connection, and silence had begun to feel normal.

       One early morning, just before his shift ended, a power outage plunged the room into darkness. For the first time, the lights did not come back on. Leo stood there, surrounded by quiet, aware of how small the room felt without its artificial brightness. When the emergency lights finally flickered on, he felt something shift inside him. He turned off the monitors, locked the door, and stepped outside into the pale light of dawn.

       The sky was wide and open, painted with colors he hadn’t watched in years. Leo breathed deeply, feeling both exposed and free. He took out his phone and hesitated, then typed a simple message he had been avoiding for too long: “Hey, I know it’s been a while. Want to catch up?” As he walked home, the city slowly waking around him, Leo realized that some rooms only lose their power the moment you decide to leave them.
