     The message arrived at exactly 2:17 a.m., the same time his mother used to wake him for school. Daniel stared at his phone, his chest tightening as he read her name on the screen. It had been a year since the hospital room, a year since the silence settled into the house. His fingers trembled before he finally opened the message.

     She wrote about ordinary things—watering the plants, feeding the stray cat, reminding him not to skip meals when he felt sad. Then the words grew deeper. She said she knew he would try to be strong, but strength didn’t mean hiding pain. Loving someone, she wrote, meant letting yourself feel the loss too.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time Daniel finished reading, tears blurred his vision. The message didn’t bring her back, but it gave him something else—permission to move forward without guilt. For the first time in a year, he whispered “thank you” into the quiet room and slept without the ache feeling so heavy.
