       The bench had been there longer than most people remembered. Its paint had peeled away in thin curls, and one leg was slightly shorter than the rest, making it wobble if you sat too close to the edge. It rested beside a weathered road sign that read KILOMETER 0, the official beginning of a highway that led everywhere and nowhere at once. Most people passed it without noticing.

      <p>
       Mia noticed it because she was looking for a place where nothing was expected of her. Every Sunday morning, she sat there with a notebook balanced on her knees, its pages blank but heavy with intention. She told herself she would write—about her dreams, her fears, the life she thought she should already have figured out by now. Instead, she watched cars accelerate into the distance, wondering why starting felt harder than leaving.
      </p>

      <p>
       One morning, a man sat down beside her without asking. He looked to be in his late sixties, dressed neatly, hands folded as if he had practiced waiting. They exchanged a polite nod, then returned to their separate silences. The bench seemed to accept both of them, holding their weight without judgment.
      </p>

      <p>
       Weeks passed like that. Sometimes the man arrived first, sometimes Mia did. Slowly, their silence softened. A comment about the weather turned into small talk, and small talk turned into truth. The man said his name was Arturo. He spoke of retirement as if it were a room he had been locked into—quiet, safe, and unbearably lonely. Mia confessed that she felt like her life had already fallen behind schedule, that everyone else seemed to know where they were going.
      </p>

      <p>
       Arturo listened carefully, never interrupting. He said that when he was younger, he believed beginnings only belonged to the brave and the young. Sitting on that bench, watching cars race forward, made him realize how wrong he had been. “Every day we wake up,” he said, “is a starting point. We just don’t mark it.”
      </p>

      <p>
       One Sunday, rain fell lightly, turning the road dark and reflective. Arturo didn’t come. Mia waited longer than usual, the bench cold beneath her. Just as she stood to leave, she noticed a folded piece of paper taped beneath the seat. The handwriting was careful but shaky.
      </p>

      <p>
       <i>“Thank you for reminding me that it’s not too late to begin again. I’m starting somewhere else today.”</i>
      </p>

      <p>
       Mia smiled, her chest tightening in a way that felt hopeful instead of heavy. She opened her notebook and, for the first time, didn’t hesitate. At Kilometer Zero, she wrote her first sentence—not about fear, but about movement.
      </p>

      <p>
       The bench remained, quiet and waiting, ready for whoever needed a place to start.
